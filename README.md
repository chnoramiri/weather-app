# Weather Web App

The Weather Web App is an application that leverages the OpenWeather API to provide real-time weather data for selected cities and the IP Stack API to determine the user's current location. Users can choose from a list of cities, including London, Amsterdam, Moscow, New York, and their home city (set as a default). The app displays essential weather information, including temperature, the current weather icon, weather description, pressure, wind speed, "feels like" temperature, and humidity. Additionally, users can refresh the page to update weather data in real-time.

**Features:**

- **Responsive and Adaptive Design:** The app is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Well-Organized Code Structure:** The project follows a structured and organized codebase, making it maintainable and easy to collaborate on.
- **City Data Storage:** Users can save and switch between selected cities, providing a convenient way to check the weather for different locations.
- **Location Detection:** The app uses IP Stack with the provided API key to determine the user's current location, enhancing the user experience.
- **Weather Data Retrieval:** Real-time weather information is obtained using the OpenWeatherMap API with the given API key, providing accurate and up-to-date weather details.
